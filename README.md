Customer Churn Prediction Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a business by using deep learning techniques. The goal is to analyze various factors such as customer behavior, subscription details, usage patterns, and demographic information to predict whether a customer will leave the company (churn) or stay.

By identifying customers at risk of leaving, the model enables businesses to take proactive measures, such as targeted marketing or customer retention strategies, to improve customer satisfaction and reduce churn rates.

Key highlights of the project:

Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data, performed feature scaling, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Development:  Developed a Neural Network model to assess and predict customer churn, leveraging deep learning techniques for better accuracy in predictions.

Early Stopping: Implemented early stopping during the training process to prevent overfitting and ensure robust model performance on unseen data.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix to understand how well the model predicts churn.

Visualization: Used data visualization techniques to better understand feature importance and model results.

Goal
The main goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can identify customers likely to churn, enabling businesses to take preventative actions. By understanding which customers are at risk, companies can reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies.
